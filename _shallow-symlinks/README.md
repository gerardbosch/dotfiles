# Shallow symlinking

The directories in this folder will be directly tracked and symlinked as a whole instead of using
the fine grained 'per file' tracking.

This is useful for config directories, as any new file in the directory is automatically tracked
by homeshick/Git.

See <https://github.com/andsens/homeshick/wiki/Symlinking#shallow-symlinking> for more details.
