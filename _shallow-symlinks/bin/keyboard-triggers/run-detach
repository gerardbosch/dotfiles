#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Kind of alias to run and detach (disown) a process.
#
# This is helpful in KMonad as it runs commands on /bin/sh (dash) which lacks
# disown command. Using bash and `&disown` solves the problem.
#
# For a dash compatible solution use nohup: `nohup <COMMAND> >/dev/null 2>&1 &`
#

"$@" &disown
