Scripts intended to be triggered by keyboard shortcuts, e.g. via KMonad :)

These scripts are platform specific, as commands will vary depending on the OS or even the desktop
stack (Desktop Env/Window Manager/...) you use. They must be reimplemented according to platform
(Linux, MacOS,...).

For example, in Linux `wmctrl` is used under the hood, while MacOS could rely on `yabai`.
