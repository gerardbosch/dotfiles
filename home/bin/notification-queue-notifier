# Any program can send notifications by just writing to a queue file, e.g.
#
#   $ do-stuff | other-stuff >> $HOME/.cache/notification-queue
#
# Notifications can be deferred in the sense that they will be held in the queue until the target
# user starts the process to read them. This means that the user can receive notifications from
# stuff that happened even before logging in.
#
# Any process from any user can send notifications as long as they have permission to write to the
# user queue file.
#
# The script runs forever reading the lines in the queue and showing the notifications.
#
# NOTE: This script should be started on user desktop login via platform-specific mechanisms,
#  e.g. FreeDesktop (aka XDG) Autostart spec on Linux.
